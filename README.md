# Blog-App

This is a mini Blog App created using python-django and bootstrap. This app has features like blog creation, signing up and logging up. There are two users in this app: Author and the Admin. The admin has the permission to add, view, edit and delete the blog posts while the author can only add, view and edit blogs. The deletion permission is only given to admin. 

#Further Enhancement

We can enhance this app by adding the features to allow author to request to publish the blog posts. The blog post is available to see for public user only after the approval of the admin.
